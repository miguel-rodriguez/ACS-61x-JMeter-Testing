# ACS 6.1.x testing with JMeter 5.2

The Apache JMeterâ„¢ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

In this project we show how to run a test with:

  - Multiple concurrent users
  - Ramp-up time
  - User thinking time
  - Different user operations
  - Results reporting

JMeter tests can be executed from JMeter's UI or directly by loading the `ACS_test_scripts/ACS-6-1.jmx` test plan or from the command line. We first need to edit and configured the test plan variables to meet our environment details and test needs.

For this test plan we can see the following:

  - We have 10 concurrent users
  - Each user has its own site (created by the test plan)
  - Each user will run 10 test loops
  - Each test loop will navigate to the site, upload and delete content, execute searches, create and delete tasks
  - Upon completion the users, sites and content are deleted automatically

To run the test plan from the command line execute the following command:

        jmeter -n -t ./ACS_test_scripts/ACS-6-1.jmx -l reports/test.jtl -e -o reports


Note: if users are deleted they can not be used again for subsequent tests runs.  Either update the `userNamePrefix` variable to create a new set of test users or set the `deleteUsers` variable to false. The default action is not to delete users so the same test run can be executed multiple times.

This command assumes there is an empty folder called `reports` where the HTML report will get generated.

The test report contains multiple charts showing different stats.
